Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 615 rows and 13 columns. The goal is to predict the Loan_Status, which indicates whether a loan will be approved (Y) or not (N).

Variables and Descriptions
Loan_ID: Unique identifier for each loan.
Gender: Gender of the applicant (Male/Female).
Married: Marital status of the applicant (Y/N).
Dependents: Number of dependents (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3+).
Education: Education level of the applicant (Graduate/Under Graduate).
Self_Employed: Indicates if the applicant is self-employed (Y/N).
ApplicantIncome: Income of the applicant.
CoapplicantIncome: Income of the co-applicant.
LoanAmount: Requested loan amount in thousands.
Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan in months.
Credit_History: Indicates if the applicant's credit history meets the guidelines (1/0).
Property_Area: Type of area where the property is located (Urban/Semi Urban/Rural).
Loan_Status: The target variable indicating if the loan is approved (Y/N).
Steps to Implement the Project
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Feature scaling (if necessary).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze distributions of features.
Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features or modify existing ones based on domain knowledge.
Model Building:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Choose appropriate classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
Train the model(s) on the training set.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.
Deployment:

Deploy the model if applicable (e.g., using a web application or API).
Documentation:

Document the dataset, preprocessing steps, model selection, evaluation, and conclusions.
